# HACK22 REPO üëÄ
<h>Welcome to our Repository for the McHacks9 RAILVISION Challenge!</h><br>
In this repository you can find:<br>
- ‚ò∫Ô∏è The source code/directories for our RailVision train challenge solution which uses a type of <b>greedy algorithm coded in Python</b> to efficiently compute the best schedule which can be made for a train transportation system given the rush hours to reduce the average passenger waiting time.
- ‚ò∫Ô∏è The source code/directories for the visualization animation of the same problem given the input and output which uses <b>Java</b>.
- ‚ò∫Ô∏è The source code/directories for our website made up using <b>Django, HTML and CSS + using a .tech domain and google cloud! </b>

# To run the files:
1- To run the python file associated with the algorithm and see the csv file as an output, Make sure you have python installed
and run the solution.py. in the Pywork directory (You can see the average wait time as the output). 
Afterwards, you have to refer to the output.csv file (placed in the same directory) to see the most optimal schedule.

2- To check the visualization part of the project make sure you have the csv file outputted from the python app. You have to run the 
main frame file which is inside the /Jwork/src/application/MainFrame folder (You have to have java virtual machine associated with the Jwork directory) and run the application to see the animation!

3- To see the whole overview of the website built you can
