# HACK22 REPO üëÄ
<h>Welcome to our Repository for the McHacks 9 RailVision Challenge!</h><br>
In this repository you can find:<br>
- ‚ò∫Ô∏è The source code/directories for our RailVision train challenge solution which uses a type of <b>greedy algorithm coded in Python</b> to efficiently compute the best schedule which can be made for a train transportation system given the rush hours to reduce the average passenger waiting time.
- ‚ò∫Ô∏è The source code/directories for the visualization animation of the same problem given the input and output which uses <b>Java</b>.
- ‚ò∫Ô∏è The source code/directories for our website made up using <b>Django, HTML and CSS + using a .tech domain and google cloud! </b>
---
# To run the files:
1- To run the <b>python</b> file associated with the algorithm and see the csv file as an output, Make sure you have python installed
and run <b>solution.py</b> in the Pywork directory (You can see the average wait time as the output). 
Afterwards, you have to refer to the <b>output.csv</b> file (placed in the same directory) to see the most optimal schedule.

2- To check the <b>visualization</b> part of the project make sure you have the <b>csv</b> file outputted from the python app. You have to run the 
<b>MainFrame</b> file which is inside the <b>/Jwork/src/application/MainFrame</b> folder (You have to have java virtual machine associated with the Jwork directory) and run the application to see the animation!

3- To see the whole overview of the website built you can
